                            <p>We are a local group of Christ Followers. We long to see the Kingdom of God enlarged and to
            see lives and communities changed for the Glory of God through the work of Jesus. We want to
            be a vital part of this process.</p>

                            <p>As believers we desire to see the people of Albuquerque Church, our community and the world
            transformed by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, sustained and multiplied through Gospel centered
            teaching, fellowship, prayer and intentional discipleship. <br/><small>(Acts 2:42, Matthew 28:16-20)</small></p>

                            <h3>What We Do</h3>
                            <p>We believe God has empowered and commanded His children to go and make disciples of all
            nations <small>(Matthew 28:18-20)</small> and that by His Spirit He enables believers <small>(John 15:5)</small> to bring
            many to Jesus, and then to disciple them to hear and obey God. We believe that discipleship is
            the key to knowing and experiencing God through His Word and through prayer, and by the
            power of His Holy Spirit to living a godly, transformed life.</p>
